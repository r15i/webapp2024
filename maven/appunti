note that the actual deploy of the war is made by using this 
mvn clean package 

mvn compile
this only compile does not create the war file 



set up for cargo autoload 
https://www.baeldung.com/tomcat-deploy-war

mvn cargo:deploy 
to deploy with cargo on tomcat but it is not working
NB only deploy to effectively do the changes i need do do both mvn clean package and cargo :deploy


mvn cargo:undeploy 
to remove a the deployed tomcat installation
