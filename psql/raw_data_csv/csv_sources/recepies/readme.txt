* Each sample has the form <IDfood1, IDfood2> and has label 1 if IDfood1 is preferred over IDfood2, -1 if IDfood2 is preferred over IDfood1, 0 if there is indifference relationship over IDfood1 and IDfood2
  The preference sorts have been translated in two phases:
	1- search of inconsistencies among the three sorts in order to get the "certain" preference relationships
	2- search of transitivity of preferences among the "certain" couples, giving indifference relationship to those for which no transitivity has been found.

RECIPES DATASET DESCRIPTION
the description refer to dataset/foods/CSV/foodDataset.xlsx
Name			italian name of the recipe
ID			ID associated to the recipe
Link			link of where the food data has been get
Category Name		name of the category (Starter, Complete Meal, First Course, Second Course, Savoury Cake)
Category ID		ID associated to the category
Cost			cost indicator of the food, discrete interval from 1 to 5
Difficulty		difficuly indicator of the food, discrete interval from 1 to 4
Preparation Time	integer positive number that indicates preparation time of the food expressed in minutes
Ingredient		english name of an ingredient of the recipe
Ingredient ID		ID associated to the ingredient.
W			weight that the ingredient has in the composition of the interested recipe
NOTE: the last three columns repeats for 18 times, leaving empty spaces when the recipe has no ingredients other than those already entered
Preparation		english name of a preparation performed on the recipe
Preparation ID		ID associated to the preparation
W			weight that the preparation has in the composition of the interested recipe
NOTE: the last three columns repeats for 5 times similarly to ingredients

in other sheet of the file are reportet all the ingredients, divided in classes and metaclasses, preparations and categories

NOTE: in dataset/foods/TXT/textData.txt ingredients and preparation has been vectorized as follow:
- each element of the ingredient vector represent the weight of the ingredient class in the recipe. The weight of an ingredient class in a recipe is collected by sum up the weight of the ingredients owned by that particular ingredient class in the recipe.
- each element of the preparation vector represent the weight of the preparation in the recipe.

# PREFERENCES DATASET DESCRIPTION
In the file *dataset/survey_answer/samples.txt* are reported 54 user's orderings in the form of *pairwise comparison*. Thus for each row correspond the ordering of a user. The ordering is written in the form of pairwise comparison, so each element of the ordering are paired with all others (avoiding simmetries). 
For instance, given the recipes as their ID:

1;2;3

becomes:

1,2;1,3;2,3

The file is written following the *.csv* format.
In the file *dataset/survey_answer/lables.txt* are written the correspongin labels of the couples.
The label has value 1 if the first element of the couple is preferred over the second, -1 if the second element is preferred over the first, 0 if there is uncertainity about which of the element is preferred.
